Firebase Backend Authentication REST API

Firebase Golang ADM SDK ID Token

/The Admin SDK is provides functionality for use with backend code. With Firebase Auth, users are intended to sign in on the frontend and pass an ID token to the backend. If you are suggesting that you would like to use golang to write a frontend-like app, you won't find any APIs for that. You can call the Firebase Auth REST APIs directly in that case.
